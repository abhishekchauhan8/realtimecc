        Real-time solutions implemented across the generation sites helps in
        standardizing the calculation and analysis of all plant & equipment Key
        Performance Indicators (KPI’s). This helps in preventing unplanned
        downtimes and improving asset performance, longevity and increases
        overall Operational Excellence. PI system is also utilized for fleet
        optimization, risk management, plant performance, thermal efficiency,
        reliability/availability, condition‐based maintenance, regulatory
        compliance, situational awareness and integration of distributed energy
        resources.

        Real time solutions provide real-time insights into plant and asset
        performance. With these solutions, we can forecast environmental
        conditions that impact energy production. The PI Systems provides the
        data collection, analysis, and system-wide reporting tools that help
        organizations achieve ongoing performance improvements and wider profit
        margins. With the PI System, data is shared easily and securely in real
        time with partners and customers. The dispersed and remote assets
        monitored using real-time solutions improve production rates using
        real-time models and automated workflows.

        Real time solutions empower stakeholders to more accurately determine
        the age and condition of a building and get reliable information on the
        types of renovations and redesigns previously made to it. This reduces
        the unknowns about the property and its potential, minimizing risk
        factors for investors and buyers. By analyzing conversion rates,
        potential issues in the sales process are identified that ensures agents
        have the tools and training they need. With greater insight into market
        trends and more precise data on metrics such as pricing and time on the
        market from thousands of comparable properties, the value of a property
        can be determined much better. These solutions give stakeholders deep
        insight into specific properties, using a variety of unstructured data
        on how the land was used in the past, insurance claims that were filed,
        and permits related to issues with the property. This information can
        help limit bad decisions and speed up good ones.

        Insights gathered from public and private data sources, social media,
        business surveys, and other available sources of information can improve
        an agentâ€™s ability to identify and reach their ideal target market. Real
        time solutions can help in this aspect as well.

        Real-time solutions provide insights to price the products that attract
        the customers along with bring profit for the business. These solutions
        empower plant operators with data on production costs, revenue, pricing,
        target loads versus actual loads, and target margins versus actual
        margins to inform plant-operating decisions. The solutions are also
        capable of capturing and combining data from plant operations and other
        information included commodity and energy prices on the web, daily
        emails about energy markets, and long-term financial data. PI Vision is
        used to display the results on a screen in the plant’s control room so
        plant operators can track the effects of their decisions on profit
        margin as they happen. The system runs with very little manual data
        entry and, in seconds, generates statistical analyses that once took
        hours to create.
